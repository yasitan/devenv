*System Overview Diagram*

This application is designed using a microservices architecture and consists of the following services:

- **Webapp Service**: This is where users interact with our application.
- **API Service**: Responsible for authentication and management of conversations and message logic.
- **MongoDB**: The database used to store all data in our application.

### Database

The database consists of the following collections:

- **Users Collection**: Stores all user information.
- **LocalUsers Collection**: Stores user credential information separately from the main Users Collection.
- **Conversations Collection**: Stores conversation data.
- **Messages Collection**: Stores message data. The `metadata` field contains additional data for the message, such as the `secondaryId` used to link interactions between the Frontend and Backend, as shown in the flow chart below.

**Block Explanation:**
- **Update message by secondary_id:** We will base on this id for matching the message that is just sending right before. That's used to avoid duplicating when receiving message from websocket via Socket.io

## Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the devenv repository

```shell
git clone git@github.com:haile-yasitan/devenv.git yasitan
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Download all related repositories

```shell
cd yasitan
```

Load all sub-repositories inside the `yasitan` repository using the following commands:

```shell
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

All the required service code will be downloaded to the `yasitan` folder.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set up Environment

- Create a `.env` file from `.env.example`.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Build and run Docker containers

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Running this command starts all required services.

## Test the app üöÄ

After successfully building the mentioned services, you can access the following endpoints:
